# Object Oriented Programming with TypeScript

This repository is created to **learn, practice, and explore Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using TypeScript**.  
I will gradually add examples and code as I learn and understand different OOP concepts in TypeScript.

📅 **Start Date:** 23rd January 2026  
📅 **Completion Date:** _To be added_

---

## 📘 Topics Covered

In this repository, I will explore the following OOP concepts step by step:

- **Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming**  
  Understanding what OOP is and why it is useful for building scalable and maintainable applications.

- **Class and Object**  
  Learning how classes work as blueprints and how objects are created from them.

- **Inheritance in OOP**  
  Using inheritance to reuse code and create parent–child class relationships.

- **Type Guards using `typeof` and `in`**  
  Safely handling different data types using TypeScript type guards.

- **Type Guards using `instanceof`**  
  Checking whether an object belongs to a specific class in OOP scenarios.

- **Access Modifiers**  
  Understanding `public`, `private`, and `protected` to control access to class members.

- **Getter and Setter**  
  Managing how class properties are accessed and updated.

- **Statics in OOP**  
  Working with static properties and methods that belong to the class itself.

- **Polymorphism**  
  Treating different objects in a unified way using inheritance and method overriding.

- **Abstraction in OOP**  
  Using abstract classes and interfaces to hide implementation details.

- **Encapsulation in OOP**  
  Protecting internal class data using access control and best practices.
